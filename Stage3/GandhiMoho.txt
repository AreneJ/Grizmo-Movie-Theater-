Gandhi Report:

I worked on the classes; Customer, ConcessionPayment, TicketPayment, Payment, Sales, Movie, and MovieStorage.

I mainly handled the money side of the project and implimented principles of inheritence with the Payment, 
TicketPayment, and ConcessionPayment as they are all Payments and use some of the same varibles and get Methods. 

I wanted to implement a sales history for Customers to get their individual payment history, 
but I wasn't confident to impliment it into the existing system as it was.

If I was to implement a SalesHistory class I would create a HashMap for sales history and have a customer as the key with a Helper Storage class to have an arraylist of payments for each customer.  
By inputing the name, it would iterate through each key to see which one has the right name, then display the payment history.  
By proxy, a refund option could be introduced here to change the PaymentHistorys for each stored arraylist.
