I worked on the following GUIS and improved classes
ConsessionPayment_GUI.java
MovieStorageFrame.java
Sales_GUI.java
Report_GUI.java



Movie.java
MovieStorage.java
Sales.java
ConcessionPayment.java
Payment.java

I worked on the GUIS for my classes for stage 3 and managed to get information persisting between files and my classes to import it.  I worked with Andrew to transfer the read and writing that we learned in class to his to keep payment changes when they are created.  I also added more functionality to MovieStorage and Payments to read, create, update, remove everything needed for the GUIS that I made.
