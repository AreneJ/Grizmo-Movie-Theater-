I created the following new classes / GUIs and their components:
AgeSearchGUI
AgeSearchResultsGUI
BuyTicketGUI
CustomerActionsGUI
EmployeeAddGUI
EmployeesGUI
MainGUI
ShiftsGUI - a 'popup'
ShowtimeSeatsGUI

Most efforts went toward identifying where and how to implement 
persistent storage: in particular each showtime object has an 
associated seating chart, and each seating chart is
independent, requiring a file for each seating chart.
Ensuring the correct file is being read/written is largely what
any new code does. I created the 'search by age' functionality
in the employee window to give some search function to the program
as per the project requirements. Finally I created the userguide.pdf
file.
