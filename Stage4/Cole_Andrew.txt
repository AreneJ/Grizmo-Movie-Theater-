I created the following new classes / GUIs and their components:
BuyTicketGUI
CustomerActionsGUI
EmployeeAddGUI
EmployeesGUI
MainGUI
ShiftsGUI - a 'popup'
ShowtimeSeatsGUI

I updated existing classes as needed to accommodate the GUI classes:
CLI.java had a Sales object getter added, for example. This allowed
the BuyTicketGUI (which uses a CLI object) to get and use the
needed Sales object.  Most efforts went toward identifying where
and how to implement persistent storage: in particular each showtime 
object has an associated seating chart, and each seating chart is
independent, requiring a file for each seating chart.
Ensuring the correct file is being read/written is largely what
any new code does.
